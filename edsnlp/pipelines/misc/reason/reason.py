class Reason(GenericMatcher):
    """Pipeline to identify the reason of the hospitalisation.

    It declares a Span extension called `ents_reason` and adds
    the key `reasons` to doc.spans.

    It also declares the boolean extension `is_reason`.
    This extension is set to True for the Reason Spans but also
    for the entities that overlap the reason span.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nlp : Pipeline
        EDS-NLP pipeline object
    reasons : Dict[str, Union[List[str], str]]
        The terminology of reasons.
    reason_sections: List[str]
        The list of sections that are considered as reasons.
    excluded_sections: List[str]
        The list of sections we don't search into.
    use_sections : bool
        Whether to use the `sections` pipeline to improve results.
    attr : str
        spaCy's attribute to use:
        a string with the value "TEXT" or "NORM", or a dict with
        the key 'term_attr'. We can also add a key for each regex.
    ignore_excluded : bool
        Whether to skip excluded tokens.
